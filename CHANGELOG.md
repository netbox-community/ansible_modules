## v0.1.9

### Overview

This version has a few breaking changes due to new namespace and collection name. I felt it necessary to change the name of the lookup plugin and inventory plugin just not to have a non descriptive namespace call to use them. Below is an example:
`netbox.netbox.netbox` would be used for both inventory plugin and lookup plugin, but in different contexts so no collision will arise, but confusion will.

I renamed the lookup plugin to `nb_lookup` so it will be used with the FQCN `netbox.netbox.nb_lookup`.

The inventory plugin will now be called within an inventory file by `netbox.netbox.nb_inventory`

### Bug Fixes

- [#120](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/120) - Update netbox_tenant and netbox_tenant_group to use slugs for searching (available since NetBox 2.6). Added slug options to netbox_site, netbox_tenant, netbox_tenant_group

## v.1.8

### Bug Fixes

- [#114](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/114) - If interface existed already, caused traceback and crashed playbook

## v.1.7

### New Features

- [#58](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/58) - Added fetching services for devices in Netbox Inventory Plugin
- [#62](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/62) - Change lookups to property for subclassing of inventory plugin
- [#60](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/60) - Added option for interfaces and IP addresses of interfaces to be fetched via inventory plugin

### Bug Fixes

- [#95](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/95) - Updated _to_slug to follow same constructs NetBox uses
- [#105](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/105) - Properly create interface on correct device when in a VC
- [#106](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/106) - Assigning to parent log now finds LAG interface type dynamically rather than set statically in code
- [#107](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/107) - Create device with empty string to assign the device a UUID
- [#63](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/63) - If query_filters supplied are not allowed for either device or VM lookups, or no valid query filters, it will not attempt to fetch from devices or VMs. This should prevent devices or VMs from being fetched that do not meet the query_filters specified.
