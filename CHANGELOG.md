- [#105](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/105) - Properly create interface on correct device when in a VC
- [#106](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/106) - Assigning to parent log now finds LAG interface type dynamically rather than set statically in code
- [#107](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/107) - Create device with empty string to assign the device a UUID
- [#63](https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/63) - If query_filters supplied are not allowed for either device or VM lookups, or no valid query filters, it will not attempt to fetch from devices or VMs. This should prevent devices or VMs from being fetched that do not meet the query_filters specified.
