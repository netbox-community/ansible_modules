Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- To pass in integers via Ansible Jinja filters for a key in ``data`` that
  requires querying an endpoint is now done by making it a dictionary with
  an ``id`` key. The previous behavior was to just pass in an integer and
  it was converted when normalizing the data, but some people may have names
  that are all integers and those were being converted erroneously so we made
  the decision to change the method to convert to an integer for the NetBox
  API.

  which broke passing in ``ssl_verify`` when building the NetBox API client.

  the Ansible modules and lookup plugin. (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/269)

=======

Bugfixes
--------

- Updated inventory plugin name from netbox.netbox.netbox to netbox.netbox.nb_inventory (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/129)

v0.1.9
======

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- This version has a few breaking changes due to new namespace and collection name. I felt it necessary to change the name of the lookup plugin and inventory plugin just not to have a non descriptive namespace call to use them. Below is an example:
  ``netbox.netbox.netbox`` would be used for both inventory plugin and lookup plugin, but in different contexts so no collision will arise, but confusion will.
  I renamed the lookup plugin to ``nb_lookup`` so it will be used with the FQCN ``netbox.netbox.nb_lookup``.
  The inventory plugin will now be called within an inventory file by ``netbox.netbox.nb_inventory``

Bugfixes
--------

- Update ``netbox_tenant`` and ``netbox_tenant_group`` to use slugs for searching (available since NetBox 2.6). Added slug options to netbox_site, netbox_tenant, netbox_tenant_group (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/120)

- Added option for interfaces and IP addresses of interfaces to be fetched via inventory plugin (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/60)
- Change lookups to property for subclassing of inventory plugin (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/62)

Bugfixes
--------

- Assigning to parent log now finds LAG interface type dynamically rather than set statically in code (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/106)
- Create device with empty string to assign the device a UUID (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/107)
- If query_filters supplied are not allowed for either device or VM lookups, or no valid query filters, it will not attempt to fetch from devices or VMs. This should prevent devices or VMs from being fetched that do not meet the query_filters specified. (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/63)
- Properly create interface on correct device when in a VC (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/105)

- Builds slug for netbox_device_type from model which is now required and slug is optional. Model will be slugified if slug is not provided BREAKING CHANGE (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/77)
- Fail module with proper exception when connection to Netbox API cannot be established (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/80)
- netbox_device_interface Lag no longer has to be a dictionary and the value of the key can be the name of the LAG (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/81)
- netbox_ip_address If no address has no CIDR notation, it will convert it into a /32 and pass to Netbox. Fixes idempotency cidr notation is not provided (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/78)
