    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Updated inventory plugin name from netbox.netbox.netbox to netbox.netbox.nb_inventory
        (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/129)
  0.1.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Allow endpoint choices to be an integer of the choice rather than attempting
        to dynamically determine the choice ID (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/47)
  0.1.3:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Add error handling for invalid key_file for lookup plugin (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/52)

      - Allow name updates to manufacturers (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/76)
      - Builds slug for netbox_device_type from model which is now required and slug
        is optional. Model will be slugified if slug is not provided BREAKING CHANGE
        (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/77)
      - Fail module with proper exception when connection to NetBox API cannot be
        established (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/80)
      - netbox_device_interface Lag no longer has to be a dictionary and the value

      - netbox_ip_address If no address has no CIDR notation, it will convert it into
        a /32 and pass to NetBox. Fixes idempotency cidr notation is not provided
        (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/78)

      - Fixed vlan searching with vlan_group for netbox_prefix (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/85)
      - Removed static choices from netbox_utils and now pulls the choices for each

      - Create device with empty string to assign the device a UUID (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/107)
      - If query_filters supplied are not allowed for either device or VM lookups,
        or no valid query filters, it will not attempt to fetch from devices or VMs.
        This should prevent devices or VMs from being fetched that do not meet the
        query_filters specified. (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/63)
      - Properly create interface on correct device when in a VC (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/105)

      minor_changes:
      - Added fetching services for devices in NetBox Inventory Plugin (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/58)
      - Added option for interfaces and IP addresses of interfaces to be fetched via
        inventory plugin (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/60)
      - Change lookups to property for subclassing of inventory plugin (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/62)

      - If interface existed already, caused traceback and crashed playbook (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/114)
  0.1.9:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - 'This version has a few breaking changes due to new namespace and collection
        name. I felt it necessary to change the name of the lookup plugin and inventory
        plugin just not to have a non descriptive namespace call to use them. Below
        is an example:

        ``netbox.netbox.netbox`` would be used for both inventory plugin and lookup
        plugin, but in different contexts so no collision will arise, but confusion
        will.

        I renamed the lookup plugin to ``nb_lookup`` so it will be used with the FQCN
        ``netbox.netbox.nb_lookup``.

        The inventory plugin will now be called within an inventory file by ``netbox.netbox.nb_inventory``

        '
      bugfixes:
      - Update ``netbox_tenant`` and ``netbox_tenant_group`` to use slugs for searching
        (available since NetBox 2.6). Added slug options to netbox_site, netbox_tenant,
        netbox_tenant_group (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/120)
  0.2.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Change ``ip-addresses`` key in netbox inventory plugin to ``ip_addresses``
        (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/139)
      bugfixes:
      - Allow integers to be passed in via Jinja string to properly convert back to
        integer (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/45)
      - Allow services to be created with a different protocol (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/174)
      - Properly find LAG if defined just as a string rather than dictionary with
        the relevant data (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/166)
      - Removed choices within argument_spec for ``mode`` in ``netbox_device_interface``
        and ``netbox_vm_interface``. This allows the API to return any error if an
        invalid choice is selected for ``mode`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/151)
      - Updated rack width choices for latest NetBox version (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/167)
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``custom_fields`` to ``netbox_virtual_machine`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/170)
      - Add ``device_query_filters`` and ``vm_query_filters`` to allow users to specify
        query filters for the specific type (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/140)
      - Added ``group_names_raw`` option to the netbox inventory to allow users have
        the group names be the slug rather than prepending the group name with the
        type (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/138)
      - Added ``raw_output`` option to netbox lookup plugin to return the exact output
        from the API with no doctoring (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/136)
      - Added ``services`` option to the netbox inventory to allow users to toggle
        whether services are included or not (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/143)
      - Added ``update_vc_child`` option to netbox_device_interface to allow child
        interfaces to be updated if device specified is the master device within the
        virtual chassis (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/105)
      - Remove token from being required for nb_inventory as some NetBox setups don't
        require authorization for GET functions (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/177)
      - Remove token from being required for nb_lookup as some NetBox setups don't

        plugin (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/188)
      - Added option to change host_vars to singular rather than having single element
        lists (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/141)
      - Added option to flatten ``config_context`` and ``custom_fields`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/193)
  0.2.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:

        (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/201)
      - Added ``type`` to ``ALLOWED_QUERY_PARAMS`` for interface searches (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/208)
      - Remove ``rack`` as a choice when creating virtual machines (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/221)
      minor_changes:
      - Changed ``validate_certs`` to ``raw`` to allow private keys to be passed in

        is set to ``False`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/214)
      - Normalize any string values that are passed in via Jinja into an integer within
        the `_normalize_data` method (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/231)
      minor_changes:
      - Adds ``discovered`` field to ``netbox_inventory_item`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/187)
      - Adds ``query_params`` to all modules to allow users to define the ``query_params``
        (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/215)
      - Adds ``tenant`` field to ``netbox_cluster`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/219)
      - Allows private key to be passed in to ``validate_certs`` within modules (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/216)
      - Better error handling if read-only token is provided for modules. Updated
        README as well to say that a ``write-enabled`` token is required (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/238)
