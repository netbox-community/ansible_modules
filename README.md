# NetBox modules for Ansible using Ansible Collections

We have moved this collection to a different namespace and collection name on Ansible Galaxy. The new versions will be at `netbox.netbox`.

To keep the code simple, we only officially support the two latest releases of NetBox and don't guarantee backwards compatibility beyond that. We do try and keep these breaking changes to a minimum, but sometimes changes to NetBox's API cause us to have to make breaking changes.

## Requirements

- NetBox 2.11+ or the two latest NetBox releases
- Python 3.8+
- Python modules:
  - `pynetbox 5.0.4+`, `pynetbox 6.4.0+` if using 3.1 features
  - `packaging` if using Ansible < 2.10, as it's included in Ansible 2.10+
- Ansible 2.10+
- NetBox write-enabled token when using modules or read-only token for `nb_lookup/nb_inventory`

## Docs

Module documentation exists on [netbox-ansible-collection.readthedocs.io](https://netbox-ansible-collection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
