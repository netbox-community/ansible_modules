description:
  - Creates or removes IP addresses from Netbox
notes:
  - Tags should be defined as a YAML list
  - This should be ran with connection C(local) and hosts C(localhost)

requirements:
  - pynetbox
version_added: '2.8'
options:

    description:
      - URL of the Netbox instance resolvable by Ansible control host

      prefix:
        description:

            With state C(present), if an interface is given, it will ensure
            that an IP inside this prefix (and vrf, if given) is attached
            to this interface. Otherwise, it will get the next available IP
            of this prefix and attach it.
            With state C(new), it will force to get the next available IP in
            this prefix. If an interface is given, it will also force to attach
            it.
            Required if state is C(present) or C(new) when no address is given.
            Unused if an address is specified.

          - The role of the IP address
        choices:

      interface:
        description:
          - |
            The name and device of the interface that the IP address should be assigned to
            Required if state is C(present) and a prefix specified.
      description:
        description:
          - The description of the interface

    required: true
  state:
    description:
      - |
        Use C(present), C(new) or C(absent) for adding, force adding or removing.
        C(present) will check if the IP is already created, and return it if
        true. C(new) will force to create it anyway (useful for anycasts, for
        example).
    choices: [ absent, new, present ]
    default: present
  validate_certs:
    description:
      - If C(no), SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
